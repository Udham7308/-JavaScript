 Api request := The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in. An XHR client exists in one of the following states:
    0	UNSENT	Client has been created. open() not called yet.
    1	OPENED	open() has been called.
    2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
    3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
    4	DONE	The operation is complete.

    HTTP requests are made to a web server and after they are processed the server returns the updated output in a new page load. In an Ajax request, this sequence of actions happens behind the scenes, asynchronously, so that the user is not interrupted.
